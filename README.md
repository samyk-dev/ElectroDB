## üìã User Guide

### First Time Setup
1. **Create a database file**: In the sidebar, make sure the database file path is correct (default: `electrode_database.xlsx`)
2. **Click "Create empty DB if missing"** to initialize your database

### Using the Slurry Calculator
1. **Select "Slurry Calculator"** from the sidebar
2. **Set your formula ratios**: Active Material %, Conductive Carbon %, Binder %
3. **Choose your target**: Either specify active mass or total slurry mass
4. **Configure components**: Expand sections to specify multiple active materials, carbons, binders, or solvents
5. **View your recipe**: The app automatically calculates all component masses
6. **Track dilutions**: Use the dilution tracker to manage solvent additions

### Adding Electrodes to Database
1. **Select "Electrode Database Manager"** from the sidebar
2. **Go to the "Add Electrodes" tab**
3. **Fill in the form**:
   - Electrode type (Cathode/Anode)
   - Active material (choose from library or custom)
   - Substrate details
   - Processing parameters
   - Binder and conductive additive information
4. **Click "Add to Database"** - mass loadings are automatically calculated!

### Estimating Blade Height
1. **Select "Blade Height Recommender"** from the sidebar
2. **Choose data source**: Use your database or built-in historical data
3. **Select material and filters**
4. **Set target mass loading**
5. **View the regression analysis** and recommended blade height

### Capacity Matching
1. **Select "Capacity Match Tool"** from the sidebar
2. **Enter known electrode details** (material, mass loading, capacity)
3. **Set capacity ratio** (N/P or P/N)
4. **Enter target electrode properties**
5. **View required mass loading** and blade height recommendation

### Coating Calibration
1. **Select "Coating Calibration Tool"** from the sidebar
2. **Set up your coating matrix** (rows √ó columns)
3. **Enter measured masses** for each position
4. **View heatmaps and 3D visualizations** of coating uniformity
5. **Export calibration reports**

## Database Management

### Supported Columns
Your electrode database includes:
- **Basic Info**: Electrode Type, Active Material, Substrate, Diameter
- **Masses**: Total mass, Tare weight, Mass Loading, Active ML
- **Processing**: Solid %, Blade Height, Active Material %
- **Composition**: Binder Type, Binder %, Conductive Material, Conductive %
- **Metadata**: Date Made, Made By, Notes

### Import/Export
- **Import**: Excel files with matching column structure
- **Export**: Download as Excel or CSV for analysis
- **Missing values**: Mass Loading and Active ML are auto-calculated on import

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Start with the database**: Add a few electrodes first to build your historical data
2. **Use consistent naming**: For materials and substrates to enable better filtering
3. **Export regularly**: Backup your database using the export feature
4. **Leverage historical data**: The more electrodes you add, the better the blade height recommendations become
5. **Use the coating tool**: For quality control and process optimization

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

###  Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" error**:
   - Try a different filename in the sidebar
   - Make sure the file isn't open in Excel
   - Make sure the imported file is in .xlsx format
   - Run as administrator if needed

2. **Missing mass loading values**:
   - Ensure all required columns are filled when importing
   - The app will auto-calculate missing values when importing a database

3. **Visualization issues**:
   - Make sure all required packages are installed
   - Check browser console for errors

### üÜò Getting Help
If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all dependencies are installed
2. Ensure your Excel files have the correct column structure
3. Verify file permissions for database read/write
4. If these fixes do not work, contact skouidri@uchicago.edu with "ElectroDB" in the subject line to get help, I will try to respond as soon as possible
